This is a `NodeJS` application that scraps the [fuckinghomepage](http://fuckinghomepage.com)'s `image of the day`'s URL everyday [Fondly known as *SWEET-ASS PICTURE OF THE DAY* :D ] and uploads it to the specified Goodle Drive folder using [**google-api-nodejs-client**](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/) which is in `Alpha` currently though!
